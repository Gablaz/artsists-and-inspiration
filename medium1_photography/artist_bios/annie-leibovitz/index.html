        <p>Annie Leibovitz is an American photographer born on October 2, 1949 in Waterbury, Connecticut. She is best known for her engaging and often dramatic celebrity portraits. Leibovitz started off studying at the San Francisco Art Institute where she worked towards becoming an art teacher and ended up taking courses in photography as well. She worked as a commercial photographer in 1970 at Rolling Stone magazine where she became the first woman to be named chief photographer. Leibovitz later moved on to work at Vanity Fair in 1983 where she developed her signature style of lit staged portraits. Today she continually contributes to Vanity Fair along with Vogue. Some of her collections are being held at the MoMA in New York, Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.</p>
