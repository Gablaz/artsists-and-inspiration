        <p>Charlie Mackesy is a British artist and author born in Northumberland,
          United Kingdom in 1962. He never attended art school and instead spent
          three months learning from an American portrait painter. Mackesy
          started his career off by working as a cartoonist for The Spectator
          and then moved on to become a book illustrator for Oxford University
          Press. His work was eventually taken on by galleries and had his first
          exhibition for his illustrations in London at The Park Walk Gallery and
          has since had numerous other exhibitions in London, Edinburgh and New
          York. Mackesy has worked with Ruchard Curtis for Comic Relief and
          worked on Nelson Mandelaâ€™s Unity Series project. His book, The Boy,
          The Mole, The Fox, And The Horse has sold over 1.4 million copies and
          spent 55 weeks atop the Sunday Times Bestsellers List.</p>
