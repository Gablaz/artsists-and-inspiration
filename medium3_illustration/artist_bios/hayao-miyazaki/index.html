        <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941 in Tokyo, Japan. Miyazaki
          is a japanese illustrator and director and has created multiple
          japanese films that are very well known to this day. In 1963, Miyazaki
          obtained a position as an entry-level animator in Toei Animation. In
          Toei, he met fellow animators by the name of Takahata Isao and Ota
          Akemi where they became very good friends and later on became business
          partners. Takahata and Miyazaki undertook a more permanent partnership
          and launched Studio Ghibli together in 1985. They started out with
          Castle in the Sky and later on released their other known films such
          as "My neighbor Totoro" and "Princess Mononoke". </p>
