        <p>The earliest form of this art medium can be traced back 40,000 years. Painting is the act of applying pigment/color to a solid surface. Frida Kahlo was a mexican artist best known for her self-portraits due to the message that she conveyed and the bold and vibrant colors as well. Henri Matisse was a French artist, known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. Kinga Nowak is part of a generation of young figurative artists from Kraków. Kelsey Beckett’s beautiful acrylic and oil paintings are known for their almost “digital” like quality. Pablo Picasso is regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.</p>
