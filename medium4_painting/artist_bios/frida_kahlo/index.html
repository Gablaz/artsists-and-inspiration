        <p>Frida Kahlo (July 6, 1907-July 13, 1954) was a mexican artist best known
          for her self-portraits due to the message that she conveyed and the bold
          and vibrant colors as well. Kahlo was suffering from polio and nearly
          died in a bus accident where she suffered multiple fractures. While
          she was gradually recovering, she spent most of her time in bed
          painting self-portraits. Kahlo was painting her life experiences which
          had such strong messages about what she dealt with emotionally and
          physically. One of her well known works is the “Broken Column” because
          it represented how she fractured her spine due to the bus accident.</p>
