        <p>Michelangelo (March 6,1475-February 18, 1564) was an italian sculptor,
          painter, architect madn poet. He was considered one of the greatest
          artists in his lifetime due to the amount of his works ranking among
          the most famous in existence. Michelangelo saw himself primarily as a
          sculptor and hardly any of his other traits even though the art that
          he painted on the ceiling of the sistine chapel was one of his best
          works. He primarily worked with marble in his sculptures, some of his
          famous works include Angel, Tomb of Pope Julius II, and The Pieta. </p>
