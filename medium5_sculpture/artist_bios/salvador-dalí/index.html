        <p>Salvador Dalí was a Spanish artist born on May 11, 1904 in Figueres, Spain. Dalí opened up a realm of possibilities for artists to be able to inject the personal, the emotional and the mysterious into their work. He had his first drawing lessons at 10 and in his late teens he attended the Madrid School of Fine Arts which is where he experimented with Impressionist and Pointillist styles. In 1922, he attended the Special Painting, Sculpture and Engraving School of San Fernando in Madrid where he experimented with numerous different styles. During his Mature Period, he was very illustrative with his theories about the psychological state of paranoia, his sexualized fears of father figures and impotence and his anxiousness over passing time. Dalí’s most famous pieces are from this very creative period. Before his death he created The Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres where he was buried beneath when he died on January 23, 1989.</p>
