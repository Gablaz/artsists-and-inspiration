        <p>The earliest known work for this medium can be traced back to 32,000 B.C. Sculpture is an artistic form in which various types of materials are created into three-dimensional objects. Michelangelo was considered one of the greatest artists in his lifetime, primarily working with marble in his sculptures. Chen Wenling examines the rapid rise of consumerism in modern-day China and the fraught relationship with its more austere Communist past through his work. Alberto Giacometti was a Swiss sculptor and was one of the most important sculptors of the 20th century. Barbara Hepworth’s work reflects both abstract and revolutionary modern styles of the time period. Salvador Dalí opened up a realm of possibilities for artists to be able to inject the personal, the emotional and the mysterious into their work.
