        <p>Lester Beall was an American graphic designer born in 1903 in Kansas city, Missouri. He was best known for his work on the Rural Electrification Administration posters which was honored by MoMA. Beall graduated from the University of Chicago with a Ph.D in History of Fine Art. He experimented with different modern art movements such as Surrealism and Constructivism. Beall gained international recognition from his work with his use of bold primary colors, concise typography and illustrative arrows and lines which became a staple in his work. Towards the end of his life he moved to rural New York and set up an office and home there called â€œDumbarton Farm'' where he lived until his death in 1969.
